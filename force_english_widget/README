Force English Widget
===================

## Overview
Force English Widget is a custom Odoo widget designed to automatically convert
Arabic keyboard input into English characters.

This widget is particularly useful for fields that require standardized English
data entry, such as , reference codes, tracking numbers, and other identifiers
that must be stored in English format.

Instead of forcing users to manually switch their keyboard layout, the widget
allows them to continue typing with an Arabic keyboard while transparently
converting the input into English characters in real time.
